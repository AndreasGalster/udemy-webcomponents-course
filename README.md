# udemy-webcomponents-course
This contains the learning materials of the [Udemy course on webcomponents with lit-html & redux](https://www.udemy.com/webcomponents-apps)

<br>

**Some of the topics covered in the course are:**

* Fundamental theory behind webcomponents, why they were invented and how it compares to other frameworks
* A coding chapter on vanilla webcomponents where you'll be writing a small app without any library
* Afterwards we'll refactor our app to use lit-html & lit-element to make writing webcomponents easy, fun & efficient
* Before continuing you'll learn how to add unit & end-to-end tests to your webcomponents apps and run tests automatically when pushing to GitHub
* Next we are going to add more features to our app and start using Redux for state management
* After we've added state management, we'll make sure that our app and components are accessible for people with disabilities
* Then we'll turn our app into a production-ready app by adding best practices to our project
* Lastly we will look at publishing our components to npm and how to create great demos

### Navigating the folders
Each folder corresponds to one chapter in the course. Every video contains a `start` and an `end` folder. If you need help you may try to go to the end chapter to see how things work.

<br><br>
### Installing dependencies
Don't forget to install npm dependencies when you go to a new chapter. Starting with the lit-html chapter, every folder contains a package.json. To install the dependencies, either type in `npm install` or `yarn`.
